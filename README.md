## Hello!

This is the repository for my portfolio website, which you can view over at [danielharrington.netlify.app](https://danielharrington.netlify.app/).

It is built with GatsbyJS and React, utilizing Gatsby's GraphQL functionality to query for blog posts and images.

or with email at dmharrington03@gmail.com. In the meantime, here's a bit about me:

I'm Daniel, an undergraduate physics and math student at Tufts University. I am interested in pursuing the broad areas of condensed matter physics and computational mathematics. I am looking to learn more about quantum computing theory and development, as well as expand my skillset and familiarity within the discipline of physics. I'm also passionate about education, creating and expanding opportunities for youth and those with limited access to quality education. Currently, I'm looking for opportunities to develop my research skills and experience in physics.
