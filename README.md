## Hello!

This is the repository for my portfolio website, which you can view over at [danielharrington.me](https://danielharrington.me/).

It is built with GatsbyJS and React, utilizing Gatsby's GraphQL functionality to query for blog posts and images.

Hello! I'm Daniel, an undergraduate physics and math student at Tufts University. I am interested in pursuing the broad research areas of atomic/optical physics and quantum information science. I am looking to learn more about quantum computing, photonics, and ultracold atoms, as well as expand my general skillset and familiarity with the discipline of physics. I'm also passionate about education, creating and expanding opportunities for youth and those with limited access to quality education.
